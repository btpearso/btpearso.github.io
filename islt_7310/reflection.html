<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
<main>
<p> When I was deciding my career path, I asked myself how could I do the greatest good for society. Professions such as medicine, lawyer, politician, police officer, and of course teaching came to mind. However, teaching reaches the most people. Every year, a teacher can easily reach over a hundred students each marking period, semester, or trimester. But why teach social studies? The answer is actually quite simple: to do the greatest good for society.  According to education experts Keith Barton and Linda Levstik, the primary goal of teaching social studies is to prepare students to be active and informed participants in their democratic government. A democratic government is only as good as those who elect it into place.</p>
<p>Teaching social studies is purposely designed to educate students in topics that relate to topics that affect future voters on a daily basis including the following: history, economics, government, geography, sociology, and even psychology. However, teaching social studies goes beyond mere factual information in these content areas. Each one of these topics encourages the development of what Barton and Levstik refer to as “basic intellectual skills." These skills include gathering relevant information for problem solving, understanding the positive and negative consequences of decisions, and comprehending perspectives that differ from their own. These skills are vital to active political participation. For example, having students who can effectively comprehend different perspectives encourages what experts refer to as “mindfulness” and “greater communion with others”, which promote a shift away from egocentrism.  Egocentrism is perhaps the biggest inhibitor to active and informed democratic participation because it promotes the view in a student that only they matter. A successful democracy, or any society for that matter, is dependent on a society made up of people who are willing to care about another’s interests as much as their own. Without this ability, people may not care enough to be active democratic participants or they may participate for their own interests rather than the country’s interests.</p> 	
<p>Already in my current placement, I am seeing how social studies courses are helping shape students into enlightened future democratic participants. In fact, my mentor’s elective based current events course does exactly that. It is structured to broaden a student’s thinking by bombarding them with a combination of various hotly debated topics in our country and equally important issues countries throughout the world are facing. Courses, such as this, that open students to a future of informed political participation are the reason why I want to teach social studies. Our students today will determine our government tomorrow, and I want to help make that a better future.</p>
