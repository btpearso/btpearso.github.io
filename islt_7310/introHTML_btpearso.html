    Hi! I am Brian Pearson, a high school government teacher from Lititz, PA. I am in my third year teaching and I have spent another year teaching in an alternative school setting. I have no previous experience with web application or development training, so I am eager to learn a lot in this course. I expect to be able to create simple webpage and have at least a basic understanding of reading and writing the code that makes them function. I hope to be able to create a webpage for a government simulation that I do with my students. However, I imagine the interface that I envision might be too complicated. My favorite hobby is probably fantasy football or gardening. This is one of my favorite times of year because the NFL draft is around the corner which I enjoy following. On top of that, spring is around the corner so I get to enjoy starting my garden and the beautiful weather.
