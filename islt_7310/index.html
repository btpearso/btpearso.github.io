<p>Hello! My name is Brian and I am an educator at Warwick High School in Lititz, Pennsylvania. I grew up in Hatfield, PA and attended North Penn High School. Before my MU masters&rsquo;s program, I studied at MU... Millersville University in Lancaster County Pennsylvania. While at Millersville, I graduated with a BA in history and a BSE in secondary social studies education. After graduating college, I was a teacher at an alternative school called Lancaster County Academy. Then I became a long-term substitute at Hempfield High School. I currently teach 11th grade Civics and Government, but I also sometimes teach world history. Some of my career skills include lesson planning, classroom management, research, instruction, and I am an Apple certified teacher. My favorite saying is:</p>
