<h3 id="goal1">Lancaster County Academy - Teacher</h3>
<h4>2016-17</h4>
<p>After graduating from Millersvillle University, I joined Lancaster County Academy. LCA was an alternative school for students at risk of dropping out of high school. I am proud to say that I was part of a staff that gave students dealing with substance abuse, anxiety, bullying, and other unfortunate scenarios a second chance at finishing a high school. While at LCA, I helped students individually with their school work as well as designed and revised curriculum.</p>

<h3 id="goal2">Hempfield High School - Long-term Substitute Teacher</h3>
<h4>2017-2018</h4>
<p>During my time at Hempfield High School, I gained my first experience in the classroom. I prepared lessons, developed curriculum, and delivered instruction. Most importantly, this was my first time creating a classroom environment that would foster positive relationships for years to come.</p>

<h3 id="goal3">Warwick High School - Teacher</h3>
<h4>2018-Present</h4>
    <p>In my current position, I have focused my lessons on the 4C's of 21st century skills. Students who have developed their critical thinking, communication, cooperation, and creativity skills are more aptly equipped to excel in their careers after school. I have also had the privilege of coaching our school's chess team and unified track team, as well as advising our philosophy club.</p>
